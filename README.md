# My Fit Journal App
## Introduction
My Fit Journal is an app used to record your body measurements. It is a useful tool to keep records of your health, understanding your body, and can help you stay motivated with your fitness goals. 

This is an app that I had in mind when I first started programming. A personal trainer used to record my measurements on his phone with a notes app. I thought it would be a good idea to create an app for this instead.

This repo is for the front-end of my final project of my Software Engineering bootcamp. I used React to build the user interface and created React Routers to navigate through the different components of the app.
